          Thank you for loving me in ways that are patient, genuine, and unconditional. Thank you for understanding me without judgment, for standing by me when things get messy, and for celebrating my wins like they’re your own. Thanks for being beautiful inside out. Thanks for being an epitome of love, as your name Loveth implies. Thanks for always defending me. Thanks for feeding me. In fact, I can’t say enough thanks to measure all that you’ve done for me. You’ve seen me at my best and my worst and still chose to stay with my big head, and that’s real love my Shayla ❤️♥️.

          Valentine’s Day isn’t just about romance, it’s about appreciation, connection, and the people who make our hearts feel at home. You do that for me every single day, and you never complain. I’m endlessly grateful for your kindness, your loyalty, your love, and the way you make ordinary moments feel special just by being there.
